<p>Part I: Thinking like a programmer.
<br><br>There are five different elements involved in thinking like a programmer:
<br>1. Procedural thinking
<br>2. Abstract thinking
<br>3. Systematic debugging
<br>4. Technological empathy
<br>5. Systems thinking
</p>

<p><u>How the Web Works</u>
<p>The <b>web</b> is a collection of <b>HTML documents</b>.
<br> 
<b><u>HTML</u></b> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. 
HTML glues all types of content together into a webpage. 
While HTML is the main type of content found in a webpage, you can find many others embedded into it, sucha s videos, images, etc.
The web works by having the browser send request through the internet to a server using a protocol called HTTP.
Servers are the same as our computers, except that they are used to host the many different files that you can access on the internet.

<p><u>Tags, and examples of tags</u>
  <p>There are different markups you can use to modify the text that you see, and you can make these markups using <em>tags</em>.
    There are opening tags and there are closing tags, and within the opening and closing tag is the content that you want to be displayed (unless it is a void tag).
    The sequence involving the opening tag, content, and closing tag, is called an <em>element</em>.
    <br>
    We don't need to remember every single example of tags (because you can google that!) but there are a couple important tag types. 
    You can use tags to bolden, italicize, underline, and otherwise modify the actual words in the text.
    Tags can also be used to link the text to other types of media, such as links to webpages or images.
    Tags can have multiple attributes (more later).
    <br>
    An important distinction is the difference between inline and block tags. 
    The best way to think about this is to imagine that block tags create an invisible box around the content inside of the tag, while inline tags do not.
